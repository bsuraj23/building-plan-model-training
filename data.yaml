# YOLOv8 Dataset Configuration for Building Plan Asset Detection
# Update paths and class names according to your dataset

path: dataset  # Root directory of dataset
train: images/train  # Training images relative to 'path'
val: images/val      # Validation images relative to 'path'

# Number of classes
nc: 5

# Class names (update these based on your building plan symbols)
names:
  0: switch
  1: lamp
  2: pipe
  3: vent
  4: duct

# Optional: Test set
# test: images/test

# Optional: Class colors for visualization (BGR format)
# colors:
#   0: [255, 0, 0]
#   1: [0, 255, 0]
#   2: [0, 0, 255]
#   3: [255, 255, 0]
#   4: [255, 0, 255]

# Notes:
# - Update 'nc' to match the actual number of classes in your dataset
# - Update 'names' with your specific building plan symbols/assets
# - Ensure your dataset follows YOLO format with matching folder structure
# - Images should be in dataset/images/train and dataset/images/val
# - Annotations should be in dataset/labels/train and dataset/labels/val
